# ShareVolume - Company Stock Shares Outstanding Viewer

## Project Summary

ShareVolume is a single-page web application designed to fetch and display the maximum and minimum outstanding common stock shares for a given company. It retrieves financial data directly from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) API, processes this data to find the relevant min/max values for fiscal years greater than 2020, and presents them in a clean, user-friendly interface. The application supports dynamic loading of data for different companies via a URL query parameter.

## Setup Instructions

This project is a self-contained single-page application, meaning all HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are bundled into a single `index.html` file.
